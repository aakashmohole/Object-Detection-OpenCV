# 🔭 Object-Detection-OpenCV [Project 02]

## 📝 Overview

Object Detection with OpenCV is a Python project designed to perform robust and efficient object detection using the OpenCV library. This project is suitable for a variety of applications, including image analysis, video surveillance, and real-time object recognition.

##🧙 Features

- **Multiple Pre-trained Models:** Choose from a selection of pre-trained models, each suitable for different use cases and computational requirements.
- **Configurable Confidence Threshold:** Easily adjust the confidence threshold to control the sensitivity of object detection.
- **Support for Images and Video Streams:** Apply object detection on static images or real-time video streams, providing flexibility for diverse scenarios.
- **Bounding Box Visualization:** Draw bounding boxes around detected objects, making it easy to visualize and analyze results.\
- **Track Bars:** Used trackbars for adjustment of Threshold value/

##🏆 Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV library**
- **Additional dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)**
